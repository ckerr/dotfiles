# new-computer-setup
Personal scripts to install software and customize settings on a new computer

## TODO
 - [ ] integrate the various git aliases into a single consistent set
 - [ ] comment attribution for the git aliases e.g. `@haacked` and `@codebytere`
 - [ ] remove cruft from the existing git aliases e.g. incomplete experiments that got commented out
 - [ ] figure out why some files are getting read twice at startup, e.g. cargo showing up in path twice
